# Ethical Guidelines for USGentics

## Our Commitment

USGentics is committed to the highest ethical standards in genetic research, data handling, and presentation of results. We recognize the sensitive nature of genetic information and the potential for misuse, and we take our responsibility seriously.

## Core Principles

### 1. Scientific Integrity

- All genetic analysis is based on peer-reviewed scientific research
- We cite sources and provide references for all claims
- We clearly distinguish between established facts and ongoing research
- We update our information as new research becomes available
- We acknowledge uncertainty and limitations in genetic testing

### 2. Privacy and Data Security

- **Encryption**: All genetic data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256)
- **User Ownership**: Users retain full ownership of their genetic data
- **Right to Deletion**: Users can delete their data at any time
- **No Selling**: We will never sell user genetic data to third parties
- **Minimal Collection**: We only collect data necessary for the stated purpose
- **Anonymization**: Research data is fully anonymized before any analysis
- **Explicit Consent**: Clear consent required for any data usage beyond basic analysis

### 3. Non-Discrimination and Non-Bias

We are firmly opposed to genetic discrimination and racial bias:

- **No Racial Hierarchies**: Genetic diversity is presented as variation, not superiority
- **Population Differences**: We acknowledge genetic differences between populations while firmly rejecting any notion of racial superiority
- **Healthcare Focus**: Genetic differences are presented in the context of healthcare outcomes, not to justify discrimination
- **Equal Treatment**: All users receive the same quality of analysis regardless of ancestry
- **Educational Approach**: We educate about genetic diversity to promote understanding, not division

### 4. Informed Consent

Users must provide informed consent for:

- Upload and storage of genetic data
- Genetic analysis and interpretation
- (Optional) Contribution to anonymized research
- (Optional) Sharing with healthcare providers
- Any changes to terms of service or data usage

### 5. Responsible Communication

- **No Determinism**: We avoid genetic determinism and emphasize gene-environment interactions
- **Probabilistic Language**: Health risks are presented as probabilities, not certainties
- **Clinical Disclaimer**: We are not a substitute for medical advice
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respectful presentation of all ancestries and populations
- **Balanced Information**: Both benefits and limitations of genetic testing are presented

## Specific Commitments

### Genetic Ancestry

- We present ancestry as a scientific exploration of human migration and population history
- We avoid simplistic racial categories and use population genetics terminology
- We acknowledge the limitations of ancestry testing
- We do not make claims about "purity" or "authenticity" of ancestry

### Health Information

- Health-related genetic information is presented with appropriate caveats
- We encourage users to consult healthcare providers for medical decisions
- We do not diagnose diseases or conditions
- We clearly indicate the level of scientific evidence for each claim
- Polygenic risk scores are presented as one factor among many

### Environmental Factors

- We acknowledge that environment plays a major role alongside genetics
- We avoid victim-blaming language around health outcomes
- We recognize systemic and socioeconomic factors in health disparities
- Environmental tracking is optional and user-controlled

### Research Use

If users opt-in to research:

- Data is fully anonymized and de-identified
- Research goals are clearly stated
- Results may be published in scientific literature
- Users can withdraw consent at any time
- No commercial exploitation of research data

## Prohibited Uses

We prohibit the use of our platform for:

- Discrimination in employment, insurance, housing, or education
- Eugenics or selective breeding programs
- Justification of racial or ethnic prejudice
- Non-consensual testing or analysis
- Law enforcement purposes without proper legal authorization
- Immigration enforcement purposes
- Any form of genetic surveillance

## Vulnerable Populations

Special protections for:

- **Minors**: Parental consent required, with age-appropriate explanations
- **Genetic Diseases**: Sensitive communication of disease risk
- **Rare Populations**: Extra care to avoid exploitation of understudied groups
- **Historical Trauma**: Sensitivity to populations with history of genetic exploitation

## Transparency and Accountability

- Our algorithms and methods are documented and open to scientific scrutiny
- We maintain an ethics advisory board
- We respond promptly to ethical concerns
- We undergo regular privacy and security audits
- We publish transparency reports

## Ongoing Evolution

Ethics in genetics is an evolving field. We commit to:

- Regularly reviewing and updating these guidelines
- Engaging with bioethics experts
- Listening to user concerns
- Adapting to new scientific understanding
- Learning from past mistakes in genetic research

## Reporting Concerns
